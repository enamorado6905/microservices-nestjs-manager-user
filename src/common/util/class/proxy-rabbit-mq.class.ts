/**
 * The `ProxyRabbitMQ` class is a utility class for creating and managing a RabbitMQ client proxy.
 *
 * This class uses the `ClientProxyFactory` from the `@nestjs/microservices` module to create a client proxy
 * for RabbitMQ. The client proxy can be used to send and receive messages through RabbitMQ.
 *
 * The class constructor takes a `rabbitMQ` parameter, which is the name of the RabbitMQ queue to use.
 * It also initializes the `config` property with the URL for the RabbitMQ server, which is taken from
 * the `AMQP_URL` environment variable.
 *
 * The class provides a `proxyRabbitMQ` method that creates and returns the RabbitMQ client proxy.
 * The client proxy is configured to use the RabbitMQ queue and server URL specified in the `rabbitMQ` and `config`
 * properties of the class.
 *
 * The `proxyRabbitMQ` method returns a `ClientProxy & Closeable` object, which means that the returned object
 * is both a `ClientProxy` (so it can be used to send and receive messages) and `Closeable` (so it can be closed
 * to clean up resources when it's no longer needed).

   * The method uses the `firstValueFrom` function from the `rxjs` library to return a `Promise` that resolves to the
   * First value emitted by the `send` method.
